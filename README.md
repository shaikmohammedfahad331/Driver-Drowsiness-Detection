# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection

This project is a real-time driver drowsiness detection system that uses computer vision techniques to detect signs of drowsiness and alert the driver. It monitors the eye aspect ratio (EAR) to detect when the driver is closing their eyes for too long, triggering an audible alert if drowsiness is detected.

Technologies used: Python, OpenCV, Dlib, Scipy, Imutils, Pygame

Features:
Real-time video processing using the webcam
Eye aspect ratio calculation to detect drowsiness
Audible alert triggered when drowsiness is detected
Visual feedback showing the detection of eyes and alert messages on the screen

This project demonstrates the use of computer vision and machine learning for safety applications.
